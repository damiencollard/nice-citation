;;; nice-citation.el --- Nicer, colored citation marks.

;;; Commentary:

;; In Gnus' article mode, replace the traditional chevron citation marks (`>`)
;; with a nicer Unicode vertical bar with the same color as the text it is
;; quoting.
;;
;; The color of a mark at a given citation depth is taken from
;; `gnus-cite-face-list'.
;;
;; The text of the buffer is unchanged, as the colored citation marks make use
;; of text property 'display.

;;; Code:

;; Default: Unicode BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT VERTICAL.
